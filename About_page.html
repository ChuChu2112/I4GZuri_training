        <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Echeta, Chukwubuikem. I like to also tell people what it means - I remember that God is my strength.</p>
        <p>My other names include Samuel, Emmanuel and Chimebuka <s>there are so many of them that I'm no longer sure of the last one</s>😐</p>
        <p>The name "Samuel" summarizes everything. I'm the last child and only boy of a blessed family of seven; my parents longed for my arrival.</p>
        <p>Below is a picture of my beautiful family.</p>
        <img src="Family picture.jpg" width="30%" height="350" alt="picture of my family and I" class="family-picture" title="L-R: Chigoziem (Agogo), Daddy, Chiazokam (Zokus), Kenechukwu (Kene), Chijioke (Jokes), Mummy, Onyinyechukwu (Onyi) 🤗long name right!, Me, Chisomga (Ichikichi)">
        <p>I would've stopped here since my picture is already out, but for the sake of passing this assignment and a desire to horn my coding skills, here's another picture of me</p>
        <img src="My profile picture.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="A picture of Chukwubuikem" class="my-picture" title="A picture of me taken days before my final exams during my University days">
        <p><span class="exclamation">Oh dear!</span> for one reason or another, its broken and has refused to display despite debugging it severally. <span class="thank-God">Thank God!</span> for the <span class="alt">alt</span> attribute in image tags</p><br><br><br>
        <p class="intro-to-hobbies">I enjoy doing just about everything. Quite frankly, examples of "everything" include:</p>
            <ul class="hobbies">
                <li class="sleep">sleeping😴</li>
                <li class="food">eating🍞🍗🍝🍴😋</li>

                <li class="typing">typing on the computer (I love the sound of many "pressed" keys)💻</li>
                <li class="reading"> reading academic works and stories📖 <s style="color: grey;">please keep your novels to yourself, except off course its a popular novel, written by a popular author</s>💁‍♂️</li>
                <li class="coding">Much like my typing hobby, I like that I can create something helpful and useful with a computer by typing some lines of code. <b class="best-hobby">This is certainly my latest hobby</b></li>
            </ul>
        <p class="intro-to-priorities">At this point in time of my life, one thing at the top of my priority list is becoming a professional at something good, whatever that may be. As a recent school leaver, I need to position myself properly for the future.</p>
        <p>My priorities include:</p>
            <ol class="priorities">
                <li>Learn to code</li>
                <li>Get a remote job</li>
                <li>Expand my current business</li>
                <li>Get married and raise a family</li>
            </ol>
            Thanks Zuri for this assignment, because truth be told, I've not sat down to really think deeply about what I really want to do or where I want to be i the next few years up until now! Thanks guys.
        <p class="intro-to-skills">I don't intend blowing my trumpet when I say I'm a very talented person. Perhaps, the root of all talent is my ability to "attach a lot of importance to whatever I'm doing to the point where I give my best, no matter how apparently inconsequential the task may be". Some people call it "zeal", or "focus" or something of that sort. As for me, I call it anything but a serious name. I call it enthuasiasm, excitement, interest, fun.</p>
